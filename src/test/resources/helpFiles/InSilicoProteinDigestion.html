        <H2>In Silico Protein Digestion</H2>
        Insert a protein sequence, either in FASTA format or simply a continuous sequence of amino acids,
        and select an enzyme to <i>in silico</i> digest the sequence. The maximum number of missed cleavages and
        lower and upper mass limits can also be selected.
        <br><br>
        All theoretical peptides are listed in the Peptides table, and the coverage is displayed
        in the Sequence Coverage panel to right, where the covered parts of the sequence and the currently
        selected peptde (in the Peptide table) are highlighted.
